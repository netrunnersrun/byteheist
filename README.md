# What is it?
A simple but efficient exfiltration web server for those moments when all external common services (gdrive, pastebin, dropbox, wetransfer, etc) are filtered and you need a quick custom https exfil route for your red team engagement.

You can find more information on how to use it, in [this article](https://netrunners.run/writeups/devexfiltool/)
